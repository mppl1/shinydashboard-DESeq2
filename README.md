# Shinydashboard-DESeq2
A Shinydashboard for visualizing RNAseq data analyzed with DESeq2
For demonstration purposes, the script downloads the countmatrix and phenodata from Mov10 data made available at the Harvard Chan Bioinformatic Core (https://github.com/hbctraining/DGE_workshop). This app uses some of the analytical tools employed by the workshop. Thus for further details on explanation of the DESeq2 analysis, please refer to the HBC workshop link. The shinydashboard codes were synthesized from the many talented answers to questions on stackoverflow and the shinydashboard help website.
